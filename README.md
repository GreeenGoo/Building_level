Building Level is an application that allows us to use our mobile phones to measure the position of anything relative to the horizon. All you need to do is just put your phone on the thing flat surface and your screen will show you what is the level of these things in graphic view or degrees. Just make sure that the surface of your phone and the surface of the measured thing are tightly adjacent to each other. If the thing is located exactly relative to the horizon our user interface will show us a green level stick (or zero degrees) but if the thing is located another way we will see its position with the red color of the level stick (or measured difference in degree with red color). To change a type of measuring from simple to electronic just press the corresponding button on the bottom bar of the screen.

### To perform high-quality measurements, it is recommended to remove the protective cover from the phone and take into account the presence of the lock and volume buttons on the side of the phone. In this case, apply the phone with a flat side to the surface to be measured.
